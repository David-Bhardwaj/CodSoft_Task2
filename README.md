# CodSoft_Task2
🎉 Second Task Completed! 🎉
🚀 Portfolio Website Launched! 🚀

I'm thrilled to share that I've completed my second task in my virtual internship at CodSoft! This time, I created a simple portfolio website 🌐.
It's a single-page site built using HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript. While it's minimalist in design, it covers all the essentials for a single-page portfolio.

Next step: This project is now live on my GitHub repository for further contributions and improvements! 🛠️ It’s been a fantastic learning experience, and I'm excited to continue building and enhancing my skills.

Stay tuned for more updates as I progress through my internship at CodSoft and beyond! 💻
